## Summary

An application that uses the console to create a letter, customize it, and send it to various recipients. Actually, it saves the letters into text files.

## How does it work?

The program uses the standard console input to ask for a filename. This has to be a file that contains the template of the email that we want to send to multiple recipients.
If it finds the file, it loads its contents. Next, you have to provide the file which contains the data of the people you want to send the letter to. Then, it asks for a template for the name
of the files that it will safe the letters to.

Then the program automatically creates the letters and saves them to standard .txt files.
